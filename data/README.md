# JSON "Database"

Don't ever make a production website using a JSON "database". I'm using it here for quick local demonstration and prototyping purposes. There are no big dependencies. It's easy to explore data without install. It's fast and cheap, yet NOT GOOD for production use.

Did I mention not to use this in production? ðŸ˜‰
