# AI Video Planner

![Hello](automated-video-thoughts.jpg)

Partner with AI to generate a detailed guide that can be used to automate the spoken script, filming and production of storytelling through video.

This project was created to:

1. Sharpen and showcase the React skills with a complex project.
2. Explore partnering with AI to generate everything needed to fuel semi-automated video shorts e.g YouTube entertainment. I built a robot that could* serve as a video host and I want to try it out while polishing skills.

Next.js (React with layer of opinion and utils added) will be used in this project for its built-in routing, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and server-side rendering enhancements to get to more React-y tasks quickly.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
